#### Mid-Level Front-End Developer

As a mid-level front-end developer, I have worked on the most important projects we had, like Printi's website, Decora Printi, InBox Printi, and the internal systems that gives support to our factory throughout the whole production process.

Since I am proficient in English (C2), all the teams I have worked with for 4 years were multinational.

#### Junior Front-End Developer

As a junior developer, I have helped my team towards migrating Printi's e-commerce website from the old class-based React to the modern ReactJS with Hooks (v16+) using NextJS as the underlying framework for the new application.

Delivering this brand-new application also included migrating from Emotion to Styled-Components for CSS styling, and implementing Storybook as a component documentation. We also used Jest to cover the application with component and UI tests.

I also have helped creating an Accessibility Guild, which aimed to turn Printi's website into a more accessible one to all users.
