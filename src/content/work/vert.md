I also had the opportunity of creating from the scratch a CRUD built in Django for an internal application. I've worked with some of the fundamental algorithms, as well as with tasks that demanded knowledge about HTML (vanilla and Jinja), CSS (vanilla, Boostrap and Miligram), and JavaScript (vanilla, Ajax, jQuery)
