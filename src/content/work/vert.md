As a software developer intern, I've worked on an in-house web application built with Django (Python), which main goal was to help our team of analysts to automate securitization tasks for the capital market.

I've built CRUDs with Django for internal applications, worked using fundamental algorithms, solved problems using Django, Python, JS, HTML, and CSS, as well as Jinja, Boostrap, Miligram, Ajax, and JQuery.

I also had the opportunity of reviewing pull requests, doing pair programming, working with relational databases (such as PostgreSQL).

In addition to that, I have worked with web scraping (Beautiful Soup), UML database representations, documentation with Markdown, always relying on git as a version control solution and Linux (Ubuntu and Manjaro) as the main operating system.
