As a Natural Language Processing intern, I've worked in the creation, implementation and continuous improvement of a Machine Learning spell-checker and grammar checker software which linguistic rules — written with Python/spaCy code — are capable of correcting entire essays automatically with high precision and notable performance.

I was parte of the company's Machine Learning team, alongside other linguists, data scientists, and computer scientists.

Among the tools I used to work with, these were the most common ones:

- RegExp, Grep, and Vim/Neovim for corpus analysis
- Python as the main programming language
