Approved in 2nd place in the selection contest for linguistics internship (20h), held in 2016 by the Federal University of S達o Carlos.

I have worked at the secretary/office of the Department of Arts and Communication of UFSCar (DAC-UFSCar, S達o Carlos-SP), proofreading texts and writing and revising meeting minutes, as well as assisting in the daily administration of the general functioning and management of the secretariat together with the other employees, interns, and department heads.

Thanks to the support of the department heads and also to the dynamics of DAC itself, during these two years of internship I was able to take advantage of opportunities to take elective courses that were essential to my education as a scientist and a developer, such as

- Inferential Statistics Applied to Linguistic Data / R + RStudio (2016);
- Formal Semantics of the Portuguese Language (2017);
- Introduction to Python for Linguists (2017);
- Introduction to Logic (2018);
- Natural Language Processing I, II, and III (2016 - 2018)
